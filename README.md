# **Salary Calculator**

## **Description**

### Weekend Challenge

The Salary Calculator is a tool that calculates the monthly payroll expenses of a business. Users submit 
five (5) pieces of employee data into input fields: 
- *First Name*
- *Last Name*
- *Employee ID Number*
- *Job Title*
- *Annual Salary* 

The calculator then displays this info in a table, and stores the employee's info in an array. As 
employees are added, the tool calculates the monthly payroll by dividing the sum of all of the annual 
salaries by 12. If the total monthly payroll exceeds $20,000, the tool warns the user by highlighting the 
monthly payroll in red. Users can delete an employee from the table by using the corresponding "*DELETE*" 
button on the row with their information.
